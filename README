Why the fork of sha1sum/md5sum?

   There is an open bug with patch, but the sentiment seems to be that it
   shouldn't be included. See http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=6056
   
Why another whois client?

   1. Apache license
   2. Recursive lookup starting with whois.iana.org
   3. Support for whois:// URLs

   When I started working on the whois fetcher for Heritrix I went looking for
   some existing code to base it on. But the existing clients were all GPL, and
   Heritrix is now mostly Apache licensed. So I started from scratch.

   Existing whois clients mostly have lists of servers for different TLDs and
   such. But it turns out that today only a small handful of servers need to be
   hardcoded, because you can lookup TLDs at whois.iana.org, and it will refer
   you to a more specific server. 

   In addition, this whois client supports whois://{server}/{query} URLs, a
   scheme I invented for Heritrix.
